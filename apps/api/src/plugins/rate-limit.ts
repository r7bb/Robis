/**
 * Fixed-window rate limiting, in process memory.
 *
 * Deliberately not Redis. A single API instance is the deployment this repo
 * describes, and an in-memory counter needs no extra service; behind several
 * instances each enforces its own share, which for a login throttle means the
 * effective limit is `limit × instances` -- looser than intended, but still
 * bounded, and the failure mode is permissive rather than locking people out.
 * A shared store is the fix when that matters.
 *
 * A fixed window rather than a sliding one, for the same reason: it is a
 * counter and a timestamp. The known weakness is a burst spanning a window
 * boundary landing up to 2× the limit, which is acceptable for throttling
 * credential stuffing and not acceptable for billing.
