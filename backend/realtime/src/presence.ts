 * Presence is deliberately *not* stored in Postgres. It changes on every route
 * navigation and every heartbeat, and none of it is worth durability -- writing
 * it would turn a read-mostly database into a write-heavy one for data that is
 * meaningless thirty seconds later.
 *
 * It is therefore in-memory and per-instance. Two gateway processes each know
 * only their own connections, so they exchange deltas over the same Postgres
 * NOTIFY channel the domain events use. That keeps the merged view correct
 * without a shared store.
 *
 * The gap this leaves: a gateway that dies takes its entries with it silently,
 * so peers would show ghosts. `sweep()` handles that -- every entry carries a
 * `lastSeenAt` refreshed by the client heartbeat, and anything stale is
 * dropped. Redis with per-key TTLs would do the same job without the sweep.
